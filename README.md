Front end practical test ML

The repository is organized on two folders:
- backend-app : the source for backend services
- front-app : the source for the front end application

I chose to do it like this so, if needed, each app could be escalated on it's own depending on the requirements.

## backend-app
Built with NodeJs and Express

> To run it:
> cd backend-app
> npm run start

**Note:** Commands *npm run dev* (to run the server for development, with live reload with nodemon) and *npm run test* (to run unit test with mocha) are also available

## front-app
Built with ReactJS

> To run it:
> cd front-app
> npm run start
